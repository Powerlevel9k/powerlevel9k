where you want to show this segment.

as you wish. Here is a quick overview:

## Configuration

The `host` segment will print the hostname.

You can set the `P9K_HOST_TEMPLATE` variable to change how the hostname
is displayed. See (ZSH Manual)[http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Login-information]
for details. The default is set to `%m` which will show the hostname up to the
first `.`. You can set it to `%{N}m` where N is an integer to show that many
segments of system hostname. Setting `N` to a negative integer will show that many
segments from the end of the hostname.

```
P9K_HOST_TEMPLATE="%2m"
```

By default, LOCAL hosts will show the host icon and remote hosts will show the SSH icon. You can override them by setting
```
P9K_HOST_LOCAL_ICON="\uF109 "
P9K_HOST_REMOTE_ICON="\uF489 "
```

### Color Customization

You can change the foreground and background color of this segment by setting
```
# Local Host
P9K_HOST_LOCAL_FOREGROUND='red'
P9K_HOST_LOCAL_BACKGROUND='blue'
