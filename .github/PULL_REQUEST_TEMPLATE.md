Hey! Thanks for you contribution. To help you with that pull request,
we have here some useful informations for you.

Did you know:
  - Our development happens on `next` branch. So should yours. Please
    ensure your base is `next`. More information [here](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Developer's-Guide).
  - We have a lot of unit tests (in `test` dir). It would be awesome,
    if you would add one for your feature.
  - We have a test-VM. To test your branch in various ZSH frameworks.
    Just go to the `test-vm` directory and fire `vagrant up`. To
    learn more about our test-VM consider the [README](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/tree/next/test-vm)
    in the test-vm folder.
  - Our [wiki](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki) is quite packed with loads of information about how
    to configure this theme. If your feature has some flexpoint, the
    configuration help should probably go there or in the README.
