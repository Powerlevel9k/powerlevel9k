## powerlevel9k Theme for ZSH

Powerlevel9k is a theme for ZSH which uses [Powerline
Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts). It can be used with vanilla
ZSH, [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), or
[Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto), and can also be installed
using [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen).

Look like a bad-ass. Impress everyone in 'Screenshot Your Desktop' threads. Use powerlevel9k.

Config](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Show-Off-Your-Config).

There are a number of Powerline ZSH themes available, now. The developers of
this theme focus on four primary goals:

1. Give users a great out-of-the-box configuration with no additional
   configuration required.
2. Make customization easy for users who do want to tweak their prompt.
3. Provide useful segments that you can enable to make your prompt even more
   effective and helpful. We have prompt segments for everything from unit test
   coverage to your AWS instance.
4. Optimize the code for execution speed as much as possible. A snappy terminal
   is a happy terminal.

Here is `powerlevel9k` in action, with [some simple settings](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Show-Off-Your-Config#natemccurdys-configuration).

### Installation
There are two installation steps to go from a lame terminal to a "Power Level
9000" terminal. Once you are done, you can optionally customize your prompt.

[Installation Instructions](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Install-Instructions)

1. [Install the Powerlevel9k Theme](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Install-Instructions#step-1-install-powerlevel9k)
2. [Install Powerline-Patched Fonts](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Install-Instructions#step-2-install-powerline-fonts)

No configuration is necessary post-installation if you like the default
settings, but there are plenty of segment customization options available if you
are interested.

### Prompt Customization

Be sure to check out the wiki page on the additional prompt customization
options, including color and icon settings: [Stylizing Your Prompt](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Stylizing-Your-Prompt)

#### Customizing Prompt Segments
Customizing your prompt is easy! Select the segments you want to have displayed,
and then assign them to either the left or right prompt by adding the following
variables to your `~/.zshrc`. If you don't customize this, the below
configuration is the default:

    POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(context dir rbenv vcs)
    POWERLEVEL9K_RIGHT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(status history time)

#### Available Prompt Segments

##### aws

If you would like to display the [current AWS
profile](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html), add
the `aws` segment to one of the prompts, and define `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` in
your `~/.zshrc`:

    export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=<profile_name>

##### battery

This segment will display your current battery status (fails gracefully
on systems without a battery). It can be customized in your .zshrc
with the environment variables detailed below with their default values.

    POWERLEVEL9K_BATTERY_CHARGING="yellow"
    POWERLEVEL9K_BATTERY_CHARGED="green"
    POWERLEVEL9K_BATTERY_DISCONNECTED=$DEFAULT_COLOR
    POWERLEVEL9K_BATTERY_LOW_THRESHOLD=10
    POWERLEVEL9K_BATTERY_LOW_COLOR="red"

In addition to the above it supports standard _FOREGROUND value without affecting the icon color

Supports both OS X and Linux(time remaining requires the acpi program on Linux)

##### custom_command

The `custom_...` segment lets you add a custom command to your prompt, to e.g. display the wifi signal. You choose a name for the segment yourself, (here signal), and then set the appropriate variables, as so (based on the name you chose)

    POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(context time battery dir vcs virtualenv custom_signal)
    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_SIGNAL="echo signal: \$(nmcli device wifi | grep yes | awk '{print \$8}')"
    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_SIGNAL_BACKGROUND="blue"
    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_SIGNAL_FOREGROUND="yellow"
    POWERLEVEL9K_RIGHT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(aws status load ram)

gives

![simplesignal](http://i.imgur.com/SQmYVFL.png)

Instead of defining the command inline (if it is kinda long or unreadable), one can also add a function to the .zshrc like:

    zsh_signal(){
            local signal=$(nmcli device wifi | grep yes | awk '{print $8}')
            local color='%F{yellow}'
            [[ $signal -gt 75 ]] && color='%F{green}'
            [[ $signal -lt 50 ]] && color='%F{red}'
            echo -n "%{$color%}\uf230  $signal%{%f%}" # \uf230 is 
    }

And then by changing the custom commands array (and rearranging a bit the prompt elements) to read:

    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_SIGNAL="zsh_signal"

Then this updated command looks like:

![signal](http://i.imgur.com/hviMATC.png)

You can also have multiple custom commands. Say you have

    POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(context time battery custom_signal dir vcs virtualenv custom_time )
    POWERLEVEL9K_RIGHT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(aws status load ram custom_docker)

    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_SIGNAL="zsh_signal"
    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_SIGNAL_FOREGROUND="white"
    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_SIGNAL_BACKGROUND="black"

    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_DOCKER='echo "\uf299 $(docker ps -a | grep Up | wc -l)"' # \uf299 is 
    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_DOCKER_FOREGROUND="white"
    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_DOCKER_BACKGROUND="blue"

    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_TIME='echo "$(date +%s)"'
    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_TIME_FOREGROUND="black"
    POWERLEVEL9K_CUSTOM_TIME_BACKGROUND="yellow"


Then you get:

##### context

The `context` segment (user@host string) is conditional. This lets you enable it, but only display
it if you are not your normal user or on a remote host (basically, only print it
when it's likely you need it).

To use this feature, make sure the `context` segment is enabled in your prompt
elements (it is by default), and define a `DEFAULT_USER` in your `~/.zshrc`:

    export DEFAULT_USER=<your username>

##### dir

The `dir` segment shows the current working directory. You can limit the output
to a certain length:

    # Limit to the last two folders
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHORTEN_DIR_LENGTH=2

To change the way how the current working directory is truncated, just set:

    # truncate the middle part
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHORTEN_STRATEGY="truncate_middle"
    # truncate from right, leaving the first X characters untouched
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHORTEN_STRATEGY="truncate_from_right"
    # default behaviour is to truncate whole directories

You can also change the delimiter (the dots in between) which is used to truncate the working directory. This setting is optional. The default are 2 dots.

    # set the delimiter to an empty string to hide it
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHORTEN_DELIMITER=""
    # or set it to anything else you want (e.g. 3 dots)
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHORTEN_DELIMITER="..."

With this you could achive the truncate behaviour of the fish shell. Which turncates `/usr/share/plasma` to `/u/s/plasma`

    POWERLEVEL9K_SHORTEN_DIR_LENGTH=1
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHORTEN_DELIMITER=""
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHORTEN_STRATEGY="truncate_from_right"

In each case you have to specify the length you want to shorten the directory
to. So in some cases `POWERLEVEL9K_SHORTEN_DIR_LENGTH` means characters, in
others whole directories.

When using the Awesome or flat fonts, there is an icon of a house at the left
edge of this segment. To hide this icon, set:

    # Hide the home icon
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHOW_HOME_ICON=false

##### ip

This segment shows you your current internal IP address. It tries to examine
all currently used network interfaces and prints the first address it finds.
In the case that this is not the right IP address you can specify the correct
network interface by setting:

    POWERLEVEL9K_IP_INTERFACE="eth0"

##### rspec_stats

See [Unit Test Ratios](#unit-test-ratios), below.

##### status

This segment shows the return code of the last command. By default, this
segment will always print, but you can customize it to only print if there
is an error by setting the following variable in your `~/.zshrc`.

    POWERLEVEL9K_STATUS_VERBOSE=false

##### ram

By default this segment shows you free RAM and used Swap. If you want to show
only one value, you can specify `POWERLEVEL9K_RAM_ELEMENTS` and set it to either
`ram_free` or `swap_used`. Full example:

    # Show only used swap:
    POWERLEVEL9K_RAM_ELEMENTS=(swap_used)

##### symphony2_tests

See [Unit Test Ratios](#unit-test-ratios), below.

##### time

By default the time is show in 'H:M:S' format. If you want to change it,
just set another format in your `~/.zshrc`. As an example, this is a reversed
time format:

    # Reversed time format
    POWERLEVEL9K_TIME_FORMAT='%D{%S:%M:%H}'

If you are using an "Awesome Powerline Font", you can add a time symbol to this
segment, as well:

    # Output time, date, and a symbol from the "Awesome Powerline Font" set
    POWERLEVEL9K_TIME_FORMAT="%D{%H:%M:%S \uE868  %d.%m.%y}"

##### vcs

By default, the `vcs` segment will provide quite a bit of information. If you
would also like for it to display the current hash / changeset, simply define
`POWERLEVEL9K_SHOW_CHANGESET` in your `~/.zshrc`. If activated, it will show
the first 12 characters of the changeset id. To change the amount of characters,
set `POWERLEVEL9K_CHANGESET_HASH_LENGTH` to any value you want.

    # enable the vcs segment in general
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHOW_CHANGESET=true
    # just show the 6 first characters of changeset
    POWERLEVEL9K_CHANGESET_HASH_LENGTH=6

You can also disable the branch icon in your prompt by setting
`POWERLEVEL9K_HIDE_BRANCH_ICON` to `true`:

    # Hide the branch icon
    POWERLEVEL9K_HIDE_BRANCH_ICON=true

**vcs Symbols**

The `vcs` segment uses various symbols to tell you the state of your repository.
These symbols depend on your installed font and selected `POWERLEVEL9K_MODE`
from the [Installation](#Installation) section above.

##### vi_mode

This segment shows ZSH's current input mode. Note that this is only useful if
you are using the [ZSH Line Editor](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html)
(VI mode).  You can enable this either by `.zshrc` configuration or using a plugin, like
[Oh-My-Zsh's vi-mode plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/vi-mode/vi-mode.plugin.zsh).

If you want to display a string other than "NORMAL" or "INSERT" in `command` and
`insert-mode`, you can do so by setting the following variables in your
`~/.zshrc`:

    POWERLEVEL9K_VI_INSERT_MODE_STRING="INSERT"
    POWERLEVEL9K_VI_COMMAND_MODE_STRING="NORMAL"

#### Unit Test Ratios

The `symfony2_tests` and `rspec_stats` segments both show a ratio of "real"
classes vs test classes in your source code. This is just a very simple ratio,
and does not show your code coverage or any sophisticated stats. All this does
is count your source files and test files, and calculate the ratio between them.
Just enough to give you a quick overview about the test situation of the project
you are dealing with.
