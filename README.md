## powerlevel9k Theme for ZSH

Powerlevel9k is a theme for ZSH which uses [Powerline
Fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts), thus giving you the most
epic terminal styling in the universe.

Look like a bad-ass. Impress everyone in 'Screenshot Your Desktop' threads. Use powerlevel9k.

Powerlevel9k can be used with vanilla ZSH,
[Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), or
[Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto), and can also be installed
using [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen).


In addition to looking amazing, this theme actually provides a lot of useful
information in configurable prompt segments. Here is an example of what it looks
like with a normal installation and default settings:

### Features

* Supports `git` and `mercurial` repo information through ZSH's `VCS_INFO`:
    * branch / tag name
    * current action status (rebasing, merging, etc.,)
    * being behind / ahead of your remote by some number of commits
    * number of stashes (git only)
    * conditionally shows remote tracking branch if the name differs from local
    * current active bookmark (mercurial only)
    * various working tree statuses (e.g., unstaged, staged, etc.,)
* Shows return-code of the last command if it is an error code
* Indicates background jobs with a gear icon
* Can conditionally display the `user@host` string when needed (e.g., SSH)
* Provides segment for command history (so you can `$ !<num>` to re-run)
* Plenty of additional segments to choose from (e.g., AWS, ruby)
* Can be used as a single or double-lined prompt (see screenshots below)
* Several built-in color configurations to choose from

**If you would like an OMZ theme that provides some of the same features but
doesn't require Powerline fonts, check out the sister font,
[hackersaurus](https://github.com/bhilburn/hackersaurus).**

Here is a detailed screenshot showing `powerlevel9k` with default settings and

### Installation
There are two steps to start using this theme:

1. Install the Powerlevel9k theme.
2. Install Powerline-patched fonts.
3. [Optional] Configuration

To get the most out of Powerlevel9k, you need to install both the theme as well
as Powerline-patched fonts, if you don't have them installed already. If you
cannot install Powerline-patched fonts for some reason, follow the instructions
below for a `compatible` install.

No configuration is necessary post-installation if you like the default
settings, but there is plenty of segment configuration available if you are
interested.

#### Step 1: Install Powerlevel9k
There are four ways to install and use the Powerlevel9k theme: vanilla ZSH,
Oh-My-Zsh, Prezto, and antigen. Do one of the following:

##### Option 1: Install for Vanilla ZSH

If you use just a vanilla ZSH install, simply clone this repository and
reference it in your `~/.zshrc`:

    $ git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git
    $ echo 'source  powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k.zsh-theme' >> ~/.zshrc

##### Option 2: Install for Oh-My-ZSH

To install this theme for
[Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), clone this repository
into your OMZ `custom/themes` directory.

    $ cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom
    $ git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git themes/powerlevel9k

You then need to select this theme in your `~/.zshrc`:

    ZSH_THEME="powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k"

##### Option 3: Install for Prezto

To install this theme for use in Prezto, clone this repository into your
[Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) `prompt/external` directory.

    $ cd ~.zprezto/modules/prompt/external
    $ git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git
    $ ln -s powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k.zsh-theme ../functions/prompt_powerlevel9k_setup

You then need to select this theme in your `~/.zpreztorc`:

    zstyle ':prezto:module:prompt' theme 'powerlevel9k'

##### Option 4: Install for antigen

If you prefer [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen), just add this
theme to the antigen config in your `~/.zshrc`:

    $ echo 'antigen theme bhilburn/powerlevel9k powerlevel9k' >> ~/.zshrc
    $ echo 'antigen apply' >> ~/.zshrc

Note that you should define any customizations before calling `antigen theme`
(i.e. setting the `POWERLEVEL9K_*` variables) in your `.zshrc`.

#### Step 2: Install Powerline Fonts
Technically, you don't *have* to install Powerline fonts. If you are using
a font that has some of the basic glyphs we need, you can use the theme in
`compatible` mode - see the third option, below.

To get the most out of theme, though, you'll want Powerline-patched fonts. There
are two varieties of these: 'Powerline Fonts' and 'Awesome Powerline
Fonts'. The latter includes additional glyphs that aren't required for a normal
install.

Do one of the following:

##### Option 1: Install Powerline Fonts

You can find the [installation instructions for Powerline Fonts here]
(https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#fonts-installation).
You can also find the raw font files [in this Github
repository](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) if you want to manually install
them for your OS.

After you have installed Powerline fonts, make the default font in your terminal
emulator the Powerline font you want to use.

This is the default mode for `Powerlevel9k`, and no further configuration is
necessary.

**N.B.:** If Powerlevel9k is not working properly, it is almost always the case
that the fonts were not properly installed, or you have not configured your
terminal to use a Powerline-patched font!

##### Option 2: Install Awesome Powerline Fonts

Alternatively, you can install [Awesome Powerline
Fonts](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts), which provide
a number of additional glyphs.

You then need to indicate that you wish to use the additional glyphs by defining
the following in your `~/.zshrc`:

    POWERLEVEL9K_MODE='awesome-patched'

If you choose to make use of this, your prompt will look something like this:

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1544760/7959660/67612918-09fb-11e5-9ef2-2308363c3c51.png)

Note that if you prefer flat segment transitions, you can use the following with
`Awesome Powerline Fonts` installed:

    POWERLEVEL9K_MODE='flat'

Which looks like this:

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1544760/7981324/76d0eb5a-0aae-11e5-9608-d662123d0b0a.png)

##### Option 3: Compatible Mode

This option is best if you prefer not to install additional fonts. This option
will work out-of-the-box if your your terminal font supports the segment
separator characters `\uE0B0` (left segment separator) and `\uE0B2` (right
segment separator).

All you need to do to in this case is install the `Powerlevel9k` theme itself,
as explained above, and then define the following in your `~/.zshrc`:

    POWERLEVEL9K_MODE='compatible'

Note that depending on your terminal font, this may still not render
appropriately. This configuration should be used as a back-up.

### Segment Customization

Customizing your prompt is easy! Select the segments you want to have displayed,
and then assign them to either the left or right prompt. The segments that are
currently available are:

* **aws** - The current AWS profile, if active (more info below)
* **context** - Your username and host (more info below)
* **dir** - Your current working directory.
* **history** - The command number for the current line.
* **node_version** - Show the version number of the installed Node.js.
* **rbenv** - Ruby environment information (if one is active).
* **rspec_stats** - Show a ratio of test classes vs code classes for RSpec.
* **status** - The return code of the previous command, and status of background jobs.
* **symfony2_tests** - Show a ratio of test classes vs code classes for Symfony2.
* **symfony2_version** - Show the current Symfony2 version, if you are in a Symfony2-Project dir.
* **time** - System time.
* **virtualenv** - Your Python [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
* **vcs** - Information about this `git` or `hg` repository (if you are in one).

To specify which segments you want, just add the following variables to your
`~/.zshrc`. If you don't customize this, the below configuration is the default:

    POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(context dir rbenv vcs)
    POWERLEVEL9K_RIGHT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(status history time)

#### The AWS Profile Segment

If you would like to display the [current AWS
profile](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html), add
the `aws` segment to one of the prompts, and define `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` in
your `~/.zshrc`:

    export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=<profile_name>

#### The 'context' Segment

The `context` segment (user@host string) is conditional. This lets you enable it, but only display
it if you are not your normal user or on a remote host (basically, only print it
when it's likely you need it).

To use this feature, make sure the `context` segment is enabled in your prompt
elements (it is by default), and define a `DEFAULT_USER` in your `~/.zshrc`:

    export DEFAULT_USER=<your username>

#### The 'dir' segment

The `dir` segment shows the current working directory. You can limit the output
to a certain length:

    # Limit to the last two folders
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHORTEN_DIR_LENGTH=2

#### The 'time' segment

By default the time is show in 'H:M:S' format. If you want to change it, 
just set another format in your `~/.zshrc`:

    # Reversed time format
    POWERLEVEL9K_TIME_FORMAT='%D{%S:%M:%H}' 

#### Unit Test Ratios

The `symfony2_tests` and `rspec_tests` segments both show a ratio of "real"
classes vs test classes in your source code. This is just a very simple ratio,
and does not show your code coverage or any sophisticated stats. All this does
is count your source files and test files, and calculate the ratio between them.
Just enough to give you a quick overview about the test situation of the project
you are dealing with.

#### The 'vcs' Segment

By default, the `vcs` segment will provide quite a bit of information. If you
would also like for it to display the current hash / changeset, simply define
`POWERLEVEL9K_SHOW_CHANGESET` in your `~/.zshrc`. If activated, it will show
the first 12 characters of the changeset id. To change the amount of characters,
set `POWERLEVEL9K_CHANGESET_HASH_LENGTH` to any value you want.

    # enable the vcs segment in general
    POWERLEVEL9K_SHOW_CHANGESET=true
    # just show the 6 first characters of changeset
    POWERLEVEL9K_CHANGESET_HASH_LENGTH=6

You can also disable the branch icon in your prompt by setting
`POWERLEVEL9K_HIDE_BRANCH_ICON` to `true`:

    # Hide the branch icon
    POWERLEVEL9K_HIDE_BRANCH_ICON=true

##### Symbols

The `vcs` segment uses various symbols to tell you the state of your repository.
These symbols depend on your installed font and selected `POWERLEVEL9K_MODE`
from the [Installation](#Installation) section above.

### Styling

You can configure the look and feel of your prompt easily with some built-in
options.

#### Double-Lined Prompt

By default, `powerlevel9k` is a single-lined prompt. If you would like to have
the segments display on one line, and print the command prompt below it, simply
define `POWERLEVEL9K_PROMPT_ON_NEWLINE` in your `~/.zshrc`:

    POWERLEVEL9K_PROMPT_ON_NEWLINE=true

Here is what it looks like:

![](http://bhilburn.org/content/images/2015/03/double-line.png)

#### Light Color Theme

If you prefer to use "light" colors, simply set `POWERLEVEL9K_COLOR_SCHEME`
to `light` in your `~/.zshrc`, and you're all set!

    POWERLEVEL9K_COLOR_SCHEME='light'

The 'light' color scheme works well for ['Solarized
Light'](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) users. Check it out:

![](http://bhilburn.org/content/images/2015/03/solarized-light.png)

#### Further color customizations

For each segment in your prompt, you can specify a foreground and background
color by setting them in your `~/.zshrc`. For example, to change the appearance
of the `time` segment, you would use:

    POWERLEVEL9K_TIME_FOREGROUND='red'
    POWERLEVEL9K_TIME_BACKGROUND='blue'

Use the segment names from the above section `Segment Customization`.  Some of
the Segments have special color variables, as they change the colors according
to some internal rules. These Segments are `vcs`, `rspec_stats`, `symfony2_tests`:

    # General VCS color segments:
    POWERLEVEL9K_VCS_FOREGROUND='blue'
    POWERLEVEL9K_VCS_DARK_FOREGROUND='black'
    POWERLEVEL9K_VCS_BACKGROUND='green'
    # If VCS changes are detected:
    POWERLEVEL9K_VCS_MODIFIED_FOREGROUND='red'
    POWERLEVEL9K_VCS_MODIFIED_BACKGROUND='cyan'

    # rspec_stats for good test coverage
    POWERLEVEL9K_RSPEC_STATS_GOOD_FOREGROUND='blue'
    POWERLEVEL9K_RSPEC_STATS_GOOD_BACKGROUND='green'
    # rspec_stats for average test coverage
    POWERLEVEL9K_RSPEC_STATS_AVG_FOREGROUND='black'
    POWERLEVEL9K_RSPEC_STATS_AVG_BACKGROUND='cyan'
    # rspec_stats for poor test coverage
    POWERLEVEL9K_RSPEC_STATS_BAD_FOREGROUND='red'
    POWERLEVEL9K_RSPEC_STATS_BAD_BACKGROUND='white'

    # symfony2_tests for good test coverage
    POWERLEVEL9K_SYMFONY2_TESTS_GOOD_FOREGROUND='blue'
    POWERLEVEL9K_SYMFONY2_TESTS_GOOD_BACKGROUND='green'
    # symfony2_tests for average test coverage
    POWERLEVEL9K_SYMFONY2_TESTS_AVG_FOREGROUND='black'
    POWERLEVEL9K_SYMFONY2_TESTS_AVG_BACKGROUND='cyan'
    # symfony2_tests for poor test coverage
    POWERLEVEL9K_SYMFONY2_TESTS_BAD_FOREGROUND='red'
    POWERLEVEL9K_SYMFONY2_TESTS_BAD_BACKGROUND='white'

You could also use a colorcode value. Example:

    POWERLEVEL9K_VCS_FOREGROUND='021' # Dark blue

For a full list of supported colors, run the `spectrum_ls` program in your
terminal.

### Troubleshooting

Here are some fixes to some common problems.

#### Gaps Between Segments

You can see this issue in the screenshot, below:

![](http://bhilburn.org/content/images/2014/12/font_issue.png)

Thankfully, this is easy to fix. This happens if you have successfully installed
Powerline fonts, but did not make a Powerline font the default font in your
terminal emulator (e.g., 'terminator', 'gnome-terminal', 'konsole', etc.,).

### Meta
